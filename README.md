# Eenwoud
Eenwoud (Dutch - "One Forest") is a [project started by Lobke Meekes](https://www.lobkemeekes.nl/eenwoud/) in 2020. The vision for Eenwoud is a real forest that allows people to plant the seed of a tree that has a personal emotional value to them. The goal is to keep this forest alive for a thousand years, creating a rich natural history of deeply personal stories and experiences. To support this project's ideals, we have created a digital "gamified" version of Eenwoud, where people can plant their own trees and keep them alive by staying in touch with nature. This project was created in collaboration with Lobke Meekes & the University of Applied Sciences in Amsterdam.
